# Optimizely CMS Content Provider - simple example
For Optimizely CMS; this is sample code for a simple content provider, that makes it possible to select a character from Harry Potter to display on a page.

The characters comes from this REST API `https://hp-api.onrender.com/` . On load, the characters are fetched and exposed as blocks in a folder called "MovieCharacters".

--
For now only the first 10 characters are returned. This is due to that the solution is quite unstable. More time -> more fixes.
